# Enhanced UI Features - Summary

## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. 📹 **Live Video Feed Visible**
- **Before**: Video was being captured but not displayed to the user
- **After**: Live video feed now shows in real-time on the left side of the interface
- **Mode**: Changed from `SENDONLY` to `SENDRECV` to display local video
- **Styling**: Video appears with rounded corners and fills the container width
- **Muted**: Local playback is muted to prevent audio echo

### 2. 🎛️ **Advanced Session Controls**

#### Four Control States:
1. **Start Session** (🚀) - Begin a new AI conversation session
2. **Stop Session** (🛑) - End the current session completely
3. **Pause** (⏸️) - Temporarily pause media streaming (session stays connected)
4. **Resume** (▶️) - Resume media streaming to the AI

#### Smart Control Logic:
- **When Paused**: 
  - Video/audio callbacks are disabled (`None`)
  - AI session remains connected but not receiving media
  - Status indicator shows "🟡 Paused"
  - Resume button becomes primary action
  
- **When Active**:
  - All callbacks are active
  - Media streams to AI continuously
  - Status indicator shows "🟢 Active"
  - Pause button available

### 3. 📺 **Three Input Modes**

#### Mode 1: Camera 🎥
- Uses webcam video + microphone audio
- Perfect for face-to-face conversations
- Shows live video feed from your camera
- Icon: 🎥 Using webcam and microphone

#### Mode 2: Screen Share 🖥️
- Captures screen/window + microphone audio
- Great for presenting documents, apps, or demos to AI
- Browser prompts to select which screen/window to share
- Icon: 🖥️ Using screen share and microphone

#### Mode 3: None (Audio Only) 🎤
- Microphone audio only, no video
- Lightweight mode for voice conversations
- No camera permissions required
- Icon: 🎤 Using microphone only

**Mode Selection:**
- Dropdown selector at top of left column
- Disabled during active session (must stop to change)
- Each mode has its own WebRTC streamer key to prevent conflicts
- Helpful tooltips explain each mode

### 4. 📊 **Enhanced Status Indicators**

#### Visual Status:
- **🟢 Active** - Session running and streaming
- **🟡 Paused** - Session paused, no streaming
- **💤 No Session** - Idle, ready to start

#### Status Messages:
- ✅ "Session active. AI is listening and responding."
- ⏸️ "Session is paused. Click Resume to continue."
- 💤 "No active session. Click Start to begin."

### 5. 🔍 **Better Diagnostics**

#### Smart Error Detection:
- Detects when WebRTC context fails to initialize
- Shows when media stream isn't active
- Different messages for camera vs audio-only modes

#### Expandable Troubleshooting:
- Collapsible "🔧 Troubleshooting" section
- Mode-specific help text
- Browser console tips
- Media check diagnostic tool

#### Helpful Captions:
- Real-time mode indicators (e.g., "🎥 Using webcam and microphone")
- Empty state message: "_Conversation will appear here..._"
- Clear permission prompts

### 6. 🎨 **Improved Layout**

#### Two-Column Design:
- **Left (60%)**: Media input section
  - Mode selector at top
  - Status indicator when active
  - Live video feed (or audio indicator)
  - Diagnostics when needed
  
- **Right (40%)**: Control & conversation section
  - Session controls (2-column button layout)
  - Status messages
  - Scrollable conversation transcript

#### Responsive Elements:
- Buttons use full container width
- Primary/secondary button styling
- Clean separators between sections
- Professional spacing and padding

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Session State Management:
```python
st.session_state.is_paused = False  # Pause/resume state
st.session_state.media_mode = "Camera"  # Current input mode
```

### Dynamic Callback Handling:
```python
video_frame_callback=video_frame_callback if is_running and not st.session_state.is_paused else None
audio_frame_callback=audio_frame_callback if is_running and not st.session_state.is_paused else None
```

### Mode-Specific Constraints:
```python
# Camera
media_constraints = {"video": True, "audio": True}

# Screen Share
media_constraints = {"video": {"mediaSource": "screen"}, "audio": True}

# None (Audio Only)
media_constraints = {"video": False, "audio": True}
```

### Video Display Attributes:
```python
video_html_attrs={
    "style": {"width": "100%", "margin": "0 auto", "border-radius": "10px"},
    "controls": False,
    "autoPlay": True,
    "muted": True  # Prevent echo
}
```

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Starting a Session:
1. Select desired mode (Camera/Screen Share/None)
2. Click "🚀 Start Session"
3. Browser prompts for permissions
4. Video feed appears (if applicable)
5. Status changes to "🟢 Active"
6. Start talking/showing content to AI

### Using Pause/Resume:
1. During active session, click "⏸️ Pause"
2. Media streaming stops but session stays connected
3. Status changes to "🟡 Paused"
4. Click "▶️ Resume" to continue
5. Media streaming resumes immediately

### Changing Modes:
1. Must stop current session first
2. Select new mode from dropdown
3. Start new session
4. Browser may prompt for new permissions

### Troubleshooting:
1. If video doesn't appear, check status messages
2. Expand "🔧 Troubleshooting" section
3. Click "Run media check" to diagnose
4. Check browser permissions (lock icon in address bar)

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

### Works Best On:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium) - Full support
- ✅ Firefox - Full support
- ✅ Safari - Requires HTTPS for screen share

### Screen Share Notes:
- First use: Browser shows screen/window picker
- Can share entire screen, specific window, or browser tab
- Some browsers show preview before confirming
- Requires user interaction (can't auto-start)

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Streamlit Cloud:
- All features work with proper TURN server
- HTTPS provided automatically
- Screen share works in all supported browsers
- May need to grant permissions on first use

### Permissions:
- Camera mode: Requires camera + microphone permissions
- Screen Share: Requires screen + microphone permissions
- Audio Only: Only requires microphone permission

### Performance:
- Pause feature reduces API calls and bandwidth
- Audio-only mode is most lightweight
- Screen share may be slower on large screens (1080p+)
